    <h2>Chandu Preethi</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Chandu Preethi, a passionate computer science student on an exciting journey towards learning and growth. 
      Currently, I'm in my third year of pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and 
      Machine Learning, at GMR Institute of Technology (GMRIT) College.</p>
    <p>My experience at Nlite has been instrumental in shaping my skills and expanding my horizons. 
      During my time there, I had the privilege of working on projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge of Python programming, 
      dive into the intricacies of Machine Learning, and create interactive data applications using Streamlit. 
      The art of data visualization has also become a valuable skill in my toolkit, enabling me to communicate complex data insights effectively.</p> 
    <p>Looking ahead, I aspire to embark on a fulfilling career in a top-tier multinational corporation (MNC) 
      where I can not only apply my skills but also further enhance them. I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to real-world projects, 
      collaborating with experts in the field, and staying at the forefront of technological advancements.</p>
